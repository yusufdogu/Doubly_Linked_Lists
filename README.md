Implementation of Doubly Linked List
This repository contains an implementation of a doubly linked list in C. A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.

What You’ll Find
Implementation: Code for creating, adding, removing, and traversing nodes in a doubly linked list.
Examples: Detailed examples of how to manipulate the list, including adding and removing nodes from the beginning, end, and middle of the list.
Interactive Learning: Interactive explanations and step-by-step guides to help you understand how doubly linked lists work.
Getting Started
To get started with the code:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the code using a C compiler.
Run the examples provided to see how the doubly linked list functions.

Conclusion
In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive implementation of a doubly linked list, covering essential operations and providing interactive examples. So far, we’ve explored both singly and doubly linked lists. Stay tuned for more data structures and algorithms as we continue to dive deeper into this fascinating field.

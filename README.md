Implementation of Doubly Linked List
This repository contains an implementation of a doubly linked list in C. A doubly linked list is a data structure where each node contains pointers to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.


For more detailed explanations and examples, visit my Medium page where I delve deeper into data structures and algorithms.
